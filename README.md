## How It Works

### Story Structure and Navigation
Enchanted Fairytales presents stories as a series of interconnected story sections.

Each story section is an object containing a unique ID, narrative text, an associated image path, and choices for the next section of the story. The app dynamically renders these sections based on user choices, leading to different story paths and endings.

### Data Structure
The stories are in a JSON format to keep the focus on the front-end and make additions of new content simple. Each story is an array of `StorySection` objects, with each object representing a plot point of the story. These sections are linked through `choices`, where each choice has `text` that appears as options for the user to click on and a `next` property that tells the app the ID of the next story section to navigate to based on the user's choice.

Example story section:
``` JSON
{
        "id": 4,
        "text": "Whiskers helps the daisy remember its song, uncovering a hidden key beneath its petals. Suddenly, a magical storm begins. Should Whiskers seek shelter or make her way back home?",
        "image": "4.png",
        "choices": [
            {
                "text": "seek shelter",
                "next": 8
            },
            {
                "text": "return home",
                "next": 9
            }
        ]
    }
```


### Program Components
- **App**: Serves as the app's main entry point and state manager for the selected story. 
- **StoryModal**: Displays the current story section and navigates to different story sections based on choices made.

### Styling
Vanilla CSS is used for styling and responsiveness on different-sized devices.  I have some ideas for some restructuring of the "themed" colors for each story to make it less hard-coded, but it's not really necessary in its current state with such a small number of stories.
